# **Building a Server-Side RESTful App with Express**

This project served as an opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience in building a server-side RESTful application with Express.js. By working through this project, I learned and implemented:

1. Express Routers: I structured my application's routes and endpoints using Express routers, fostering a well-organized and modular codebase.

2. Route Parameters: I acquired the ability to manage dynamic data by leveraging route parameters to extract information from URLs effectively.

3. Dependencies: I learned how to manage them using npm.

4. Middleware: I implemented middleware functions to augment my application's functionality, like logging.

5. Handling POST and GET Requests: To create and retrieve data from my server effectively.

6. Model-View-Controller (MVC): The adoption of the MVC architectural pattern allowed me to structure my application for superior organization and maintainability.

7. Sending Files: In this case, images.

8. Serving Websites with Node: Serving static websites using Node.js.

9. Templating Engines (Handlebars): The integration of Handlebars, a popular templating engine, enabled me to create dynamic web pages and render data on the server seamlessly.

10. Layouts and Separation of Concerns: I implemented layouts and effectively separated concerns within my project, significantly improving code maintainability and reusability.
